### Who am I?

My name is Ashish and I'm an AI Trainer at Teenage Coder, and on the side, I make YouTube videos about coding and tech. I'm also working as an AI trainer at Elite Techno Groups and made India's first Self Driving Cars course with them. I've trained more than 20000 students on different technologies like AI, Data Science, Computer Vision, and the Internet of Things. I'm passionate about teaching and giving students the skillset to learn cutting-edge skills.
